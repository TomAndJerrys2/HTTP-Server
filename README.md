# HTTP-Server

Basic Web HTTP Server Implementations to understand how requests and responses of
a Web Server work and how it interacts with the client. More importantly, I thought
it would be interesting to try three different implementation approaches;

<b>NodeJS | Rust | Java</b> HTTP Server libraries can all be found here as well as a server
benchmarking software to test and benchmark the performance of the 3 languages. I thought
this would be a good experiment to do and to compare all parameters of the 3 servers in a
documented report with the analysis which can be generated in multiple file formats by the
benchmarking software
